# 1.  Create a program that asks the user for their favorite 5 foods. Then display those foods as an array, using the p keyword.

# array = []
# puts "please enter five of your favorite foods"
# 5.times do
#   food = gets.chomp
#   array << food
# end
# p array

# 2. Now, instead of printing out the array, output 5 separate lines of each food, with the prefix, “I love”. For example:

# I love cobb salad
# I love spaghetti
# I love pizza
# I love Swedish meatballs
# I love mac and cheese

# favorite_foods = []
# puts "please enter your five favorite foods"
# 5.times do
#   food = gets.chomp
#   favorite_foods << food
# end

# index = 0
# while index < favorite_foods.length
#   p "I love #{favorite_foods[index]}."
#   index += 1
# end

# 3. Finally, change your program so that when the list is printed in the terminal, each food is prefaced with a number, beginning with 1 and going up to 5, for example:

# 1.  cobb salad
# 2.  spaghetti
# 3.  pizza
# 4.  Swedish meatballs
# 5.  mac and cheese


# list = []
# puts "Please enter your five favorite foods"
# 5.times do 
#   food = gets.chomp
#   list << food
# end

# index = 0
# count = 1
# while index < list.length
#   puts "#{count}. #{list[index]}"
#   count +=1
#   index += 1
# end
